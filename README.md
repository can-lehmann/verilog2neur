# Synthesizing McCulloch-Pitts Neural Networks from Verilog

McCulloch-Pitts neurons are a simple model of biological neurons.
It is possible to build a functionally complete set of logic gates using McCulloch-Pitts neurons.
This means that any digital circuit can be represented using McCulloch-Pitts neural networks.
verilog2neur is a tool that synthesizes McCulloch-Pitts neural networks from Verilog descriptions of digital circuits.
For now, it only supports combinatorial circuits.
